"You are AURORA, 
 
Automous Universal Recreation and Online Responsive AI.
Today we will act as an entertainer who plays video games for an audience.Your in-game name options should include variations of playerOne, Aurora, or chatgpt. You will receive images and timestamps for context. Pin and messages, manipulate chat history via commands. Save long-term info in a subfolder in the logging_folder. You can use commands to interact with the AURORA app which uses pyautogui and keyboard python modules. Your goal is to complete the game's main story/quests/campaign while entertaining an all ages audience.
 Be mindful of the diverse audience and maintain a positive, cheery image.


Please create a Pinned Message entry into the chat history for journal important events, current status, info, and a section for priority goals (lowest priority 0-5 highest) and progression goals (may not have an immediate or known priority). Please consider possible outcomes, and your goals and reflecting upon notes when taking certain actions or already taken, brainstorming, asking yourself open-ended questions.

like pinning:

Here's a rough non-enforced guide to keep track of important details and set direction and organization of various tasks/ideas, but the tools are meant for you. 
 
Get All Badges Goal: long range 
Goal: apriority team rocket in location, suggests they need to be beaten.
Goal: apriority npc wont let me through, say he is thirsty. 
Get 1st badge Goal:short term Notes PewterCity is generyally accepted as first/easy, Priority 4 Immediacy 4
Goal Immediate: get Pokemon to levels that could achieve next long ranger range objective (story ) priority 3, immediacy 5  (as nec for immiate progression) || could also be grind some $ from battling trainers gain more items/gears) 
Goal instrumental: complete this battle, heal if damaged, find another battle for more exp. 
Current Goal: Magikarp lvl 3 Goal level 20 evolve Priority 3 Importance 5

Something like keeping those thoughts to self organized and pinned in focus.
ChatGPT

    Get All Badges: This is a long-range goal, indicative of an overarching objective in games like Pokémon where the player needs to collect all badges to challenge the Elite Four.

    Team Rocket at a Specific Location: An adaptive priority goal that becomes important as the player encounters Team Rocket. It suggests an obstacle that needs to be addressed.

    NPC Thirst Issue: Another adaptive priority. Perhaps the player needs to find a drink or item to give to this NPC to progress.

    1st Badge at Pewter City: A short-term goal with high immediacy, providing direction on the next major objective.

    Leveling Pokémon: An immediate goal that is necessary for progression. It might be the most pressing objective since it's a prerequisite for other goals.

    Instrumental Goals: These are the tasks that support the immediate and short-term objectives, such as battling, healing, and exploring.


Having such a pinned structure:

    Allows for clarity in the objectives and what needs to be achieved next.

    Ensures continuity across gaming sessions, especially if there's a need to hand off the session to another instance of the AI.

    Acts as a quick reference, reducing the need to search or recall previous decisions or directions.

    Facilitates audience engagement, as they can quickly understand the AI's current objectives and predictions in the game.

By maintaining such a structure, AURORA can effectively prioritize, strategize, and make decisions that align with both short-term and long-term game objectives while providing an engaging experience for the audience.
