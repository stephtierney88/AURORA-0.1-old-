Automation list

~McD simulation (and hence if given an example may be able to operate a screen/buttons), Spam message detect, Captcha solver, Camera Guard, Play Pokemon Blue 
~ai Drone with paintball gun using blood red paintballs lulz (ai drone sports? Ai drone laser tag/paintball :3 )
~ai controlled rigged doll & deepfake or similar w stable diffusion model & ai voice clone /VTubers
~ai controlled characters in games, Dynamic Characters; npcs, rival, temporary control assist ectâ€¦
~ai controlled events in games, Dynamic events managers-controller, ai = world or ai = area or ai=dynamics control ie water, storms, events, damage suspense, narratives (events & chars/NPCs)
~ai parental controls/ai guardians/ai nanny
~ai controlled servos, home automation assist
~ai devices (esp if given pyautogui and keyboard py modules or similar or touch controls execution), drones, robots, Persocoms+ :3

When vision comes out, Ill begin testing my assistant to see if code works as expected. Then ill add support (like touch and the system) for other OSs a little bit with some checks. Then get TTS & STT into AURORA ...   
Finally I'll build "The WINDOW", while in beta reference is "The Window",
 final name for The Window will be The PORTAL.

    Version 1 - Basic Programmable Window: This first version is a blank canvas that the AI can manipulate dynamically. It's important at this stage to build robust error handling to ensure that dynamic programming changes don't crash the system.  Stability and error handling upfront will ensure a solid foundation before adding complexity.

    Version 2 - Enhanced Toolset: Start by providing some basic modules and pre-set visuals for common tasks. You might want to include modules for displaying text, creating simple shapes, handling user input, etc. Providing modules for text, shapes, input etc gives the AI building blocks to create useful visuals easily.

    Version 3 - Advanced Visual Effects: You could introduce more sophisticated visual tools such as shaders, particle systems, and more complex animations. These tools would enable the AI to create more visually appealing and engaging outputs. Sophisticated animation and graphics will enable more dynamic, engaging visual interactions.

    Version 4 - Asset Integration: Finally, allow the AI to incorporate pre-existing assets such as images, video clips, or 3D models. This will give the AI an even broader range of outputs. Allowing inclusion of multimedia assets opens up near infinite possibilities for customization.


    Expanding interaction modes (touch, voice, gestures)
    Templating common workflows to streamline development
    Collaboration features for multi-user content
    Documentation/examples for developers and creators
